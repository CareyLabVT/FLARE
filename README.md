# FLARE
Forecasting Lake And Reservoir Ecosystems

Directions for using FLARE
note: that FLARE has not been fully generalized and only works at Falling Creek Reservoir.  We are working to generalize for use in other lakes and look forward to collaborating with others to get FLARE working at your site!

Users guide is pending

# Setting up data repositories for FCR

In your `data_location` directory run the following five commands at the command line:

`git clone -b carina-data --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/CareyLabVT/SCCData.git carina-data`

`git clone -b mia-data --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/CareyLabVT/SCCData.git mia-data`

`git clone -b diana-data --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/CareyLabVT/SCCData.git diana-data`

`git clone -b fcre --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/CareyLabVT/noaa_gefs_forecasts.git fcre`

`git clone -b manual-data --single-branch --depth 1 https://github.com/CareyLabVT/SCCData.git manual-data`

You will also need to download the meterology file (`Met_final_2015_2019.csv`)from the Environmental Data Initiative and place it in the `manual-data` directory:  https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.389.4

# Initiating a simulation

1) Create a directory (`forecast_location`) where you will move simulation configuration files and where you want FLARE to save the forecast output.

2) Copy the `configure_FLARE.R` from `FLARE/example_configuration_files/` to your `forecast_location`. 

3) Copy the relevant General Lake Model nml files `FLARE/example_configuration_files/` to your `forecast_location`

4) Copy either of the two files below to from the `FLARE/example_configuration_files/` to `forecast_location`

 * `initiate_forecast_example.R` provides an example for running FLARE once. 

 * `automated_forecast_launch_example.R` provides an example for automated running of forecasts.  

5) Modify your `initiate_forecast_example.R` or `automated_forecast_launch_example.R` and `configure_FLARE.R` scripts to customize your simulation.

6) Run `initiate_forecast_example.R` or `automated_forecast_launch_example.R`
