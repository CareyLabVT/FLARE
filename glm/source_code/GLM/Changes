#
#
# 2014/08/02
# Version 1.4.0
#
# Since glm_1.3.3
#
# more FABM mods :
#   Updated to new fabm on 2014-06-10
#   Removed driver/glm Makefile and fabm_driver - fabm doesnt use them anymore
#   Remove "conserved quantities" which are no longer supported - the new mechanism
#     will take more work than they are worth. - sigh
#   Update time_treatment to new "output_*" - sigh
#   Updated the FABM macros to the new FABM macros - sigh
#   Changed totals module to do the calculations in "do" instead of "conserved quantities"
#   Changed sedflux to use diagnostic variables instead of state vars
#   Removed unimplemented "bacteria" and "viruses" modules
#
# made the output time strings reflect the actual time of output
# Modified start date reflect the start date (previously started a day early).
# Fixed inflows bug : was not inserting inflow if it failed to reach neutral buoyancy in the daily time step
# Fixed a long standing, unnoticed bug with benthic processing.
# Fixed a bug in lake.csv - some columns were always "missing" (introduced by libutil split)
# Fixed minor bug where lake.csv was empty if csv_point_nlevs was 0
# Fixed a bug in initialization that crashed if there were more WQ variables in
#    inflow that in FABM
# Added support for different plots.nml file names - now if a name
#   appears after the --xdisp (without a preceding --) then it is assumed to be
#   a plots.nml filename and is used instead of the default.
# Fixed a bug where surface flux was being added twice
# Added support for fonts in plotting.
# Fixed plot window name (again...)
# Renamed glm variables with FABM in them to WQ instead. This is prepatory to allowing
#   other forms of WQ calculations (eg libaed2)
#   also renamed glm_fabm.h to glm_wqual.h
# Added outflow output files in the format of inflow files.
# Changed &fabm_setup to wq_setup (and fabm_nml_file to wq_nml_file) in glm.nml
# If out_dir doesn't exist, attempt to create it
# Added time format option to csv files
# Added passing of bottom_stress to FABM from GLM [NB this is non-functional because GLM does not have bottom stress yet]
# Added benthic light area code
# Preliminary support for non-gui OS-X version.  Unfortunately this was broken again
#  when fabm was updated. Although the new fabm will build, the compiler hangs on glm_fabm.F90 trying
#  to load fabm.mod.
# Split glm_model to support non-averaged inflow/outflow and meteo
# Separated from libutil library.
# added scaling factors for met variables other than wind.
# modified the way wind_factor is done, it now is applied when met is read in, rather
#  than everywhere wind is used. This might fix an unknown bug since fabm was using
#  the unscaled value of windspeed
#
# FABM mods :
#   Updated to new FABM as at 20131121.
#   Added new k_wind variant to aed_utils.F90
#   Added support for varied mobility (vertical movement) in phytoplankton.
#
#
# 2013/11/15
# Version 1.3.3
#
# Since glm_1.3.2
#
# Added more limiters to nitrogen and silica uptake in aed_phytoplankton
#
#
# 2013/09/24
# Version 1.3.2
#
# Since glm_1.3.1
#
# Added support for sub daily in plotting
# Changed handling of diagnostics vars to be as if they were time_treatment_last.
#   This is because they do not get appropriately resized when layers do
# Changed name of do_settle flag to mobility_off
# Small correction to how start date is initialised
# Put back program name for plot window
# Moved do_fabm to be after all layer resizing so output better reflects what was there when fabm ran
# Added support for plotting extc and density
#
#
# 2013/09/22
# Version 1.3.1
#
# Since glm_1.3.0
#
# Fixed a problem where if fabm is not used require inflow variables to be limited to 3 (flow,temp,salt)
# Added a version watermark to the plots
# Fixed Thermocline depth responding opposite to expected when Kw adjusted.
#  Solution: New code in glm_surface.c to avoid doubling up of surface energy due to PAR.
#  Note change to glm_model.c to recalculate the light at the surface layer.
# Fixed GLM extremely sensitive to choice of bsn_len_outl and bsn_wid_outl and users most often
#   use the default in Testsim2 rather than the actual values for their lake.
#  Solution: remove all reference to these parameters replace with a calculation based on a) the
#   area of the lake at that layer; b) the area of an ellipse; and c) the ratio of bsn_len to bsn_wid at
#   the crest.  The modified code affects both do_mixing and outflows.
# Fixed GLM creating energy in do_mixer leaving lakes 2-5oC too hot.
#  Solution: When combining layers in kelvin_helmoltz must recalculate density and set both layers to be the same.
# Added version stamp support to libplot.
# Fixed problem with save all-in-1 not getting rows right if not exact multiple of columns
# Changed phytoplankton diagnostic variables to be time_treatment_last
# Added support for plotting Radiation
#
#
# 2013/08/08
# Version 1.3.0
#
# Since glm_1.2.2
#
# FABM core updated
# Rewritten the settling - now called mobility to handle non-uniform direction of motion
# Fixed a problem with light not fading correctly
# Modified the restrictive ordering requirement on inflow FABM variables order - now should be as in glm.nml
# Corrected the WIN32 preprocessor flag to _WIN32
# minor update to csv reading to support ALM
# some addition for for support for single precision version
# plotting no longer needs temp and salinity first
# Added mixing parameter coef_mix_hyp (efficiency of hypolimnetic mixing)
#
#
# 2013/05/17
# Version 1.2.2
#
# Since glm_1.2.1

#
#
# 2013/04/12
# Version 1.2.0
#
# Since glm_1.1.0
#
# changed meaning of "Depths" in "init_profiles" to really be depths, and added a new
#  parameter "lake_depth" to be the total depth of the lake. To use the old meaning
#  you must change "num_depths" and "the_depths" to "num_heights" and "the_heights" respectively
# mixing bugfixes
#  changed some config paramters
#
#   coef_mix_kinetic => coef_mix_conv
#   coef_mix_eta     => coef_wind_stir

# corrected wind output to .nc file to be factored with wind_factor
# modified output so lake.csv is written daily and now includes daily Rain and Evap
# corrected to inflow outflow rates reported in lake.csv file to account for "factor"
# fixed a bug in outflow which put the effective outflow above the lake (for non-zero base_elev)
# corrected floating outflow to rest on the bottom rather than sink below bottom if lake is too deep
# Added fudge factor to allow for lakes briefly being deeper than crest allows
